# Equation Arena: v0 Implementation

## 1. Core Equation Mechanic

Players create and solve math equations to cast spells against enemies.

**Input System:** Number, operation, and special tiles (parentheses, fractions, decimals) appear at the bottom of the screen. Players tap tiles to place them in the equation builder. Equations automatically solve when complete. A ‚ÄúCast‚Äù button activates the spell.

**Player Onboarding:**

- 3-step tutorial overlay on first play:

1. ‚ÄúTap numbers and operations to build an equation‚Äù
2. ‚ÄúUse parentheses to control order of operations for bonus power‚Äù
3. ‚ÄúCreate equations that demonstrate mathematical properties for power bonuses‚Äù

- Helper highlights for first equation (subtle arrows pointing to valid next moves)
- ‚ÄúUndo‚Äù button to remove the last tile placed

**Pattern Recognition:**

- Level 1: Equations demonstrating the distributive property (e.g., 2√ó(3+4) = 2√ó3+2√ó4) receive +50% power with a ‚ÄúDistributive Bonus!‚Äù text indicator and visual effect.
- Level 2: Equations resulting in benchmark fractions (1/2, 3/4, 1) receive +50% power with a ‚ÄúBenchmark Bonus!‚Äù text indicator.
- Level 3: Equations showing place value understanding (0.1√ó10 = 1) receive +50% power with a ‚ÄúPlace Value Bonus!‚Äù effect.
- All Levels: Equations demonstrating the commutative property (e.g., 3√ó4 = 4√ó3) receive a ‚ÄúSymmetry Bonus‚Äù of +25% power.

## 2. Spell System

**Spell Types (v0):**

- **Fire (Damage)**: Deals 15-40 damage based on equation complexity
- **Ice (Shield)**: Creates a shield absorbing 20-45 damage. Shield remains until all absorption is used or new shield is cast.

**Damage/Shield Scaling:**

```
Base Value:
- Simple equation (addition/subtraction only): 15 damage / 20 shield
- Medium equation (multiplication/division OR parentheses): 20 damage / 25 shield
- Complex equation (fractions OR decimals): 25 damage / 35 shield
- Advanced equation (combines multiple complexity factors): 30 damage / 40 shield

Complexity Factors:
- Using both multiplication AND parentheses: +5
- Using both fractions AND decimals: +5

Pattern Bonuses (multiplicative):
- Level-specific property: √ó1.5 (+50%)
- Commutative property: √ó1.25 (+25%)
- Both properties in one equation: √ó1.75 (+75%)
```

Example calculations:

- 2+3=5 (simple): 15 damage / 20 shield
- 2√ó3=6 (medium): 20 damage / 25 shield
- 2√ó(3+4)=14 (medium + complexity): 25 damage / 30 shield
- 2√ó(3+4)=14 with distributive property: 37 damage / 45 shield (25 √ó 1.5)
- 1/4+1/4=1/2 with benchmark property: 37 damage / 45 shield (25 √ó 1.5)
- 0.1√ó10=1 with place value property: 37 damage / 45 shield (25 √ó 1.5)
- 3√ó4=12 with commutative property: 25 damage / 31 shield (20 √ó 1.25)

**Shield Behavior:**

- Shields don‚Äôt stack - casting a new shield replaces any existing shield
- Shield remains active until all absorption is used up
- Shield value is displayed as a number inside the shield bubble
- Shield blocks incoming damage completely until depleted
- Math connection: Shield values provide a concrete representation of equation results

**Visual Feedback:**

- Fire spell: Red glow effect on enemy with floating damage numbers
- Ice spell: Blue shield bubble around player with shield strength displayed
- Pattern bonus: Amplified effects with additional particles and screen flash
- Commutative property bonus: Simple glow effect with subtle animation
- Distributive property bonus: Purple highlighting showing the relationship
- Benchmark fraction bonus: Green pulse effect emphasizing the result
- Place value bonus: Cyan animation highlighting decimal places
- Effects designed to highlight mathematical structure rather than just decoration

**Visual Effects Scope:**

- Simple color-based effects only (no complex particle systems)
- Basic animations for tiles and spells (no advanced physics)
- Text indicators for key events
- Placeholder character/enemy art acceptable for v0

**Enemy Types (v0):**

- Three enemy types with health that increases by level:
- Level 1: Order Keeper - 75 health, attacks every 9 seconds for 15 damage
- Level 2: Fraction Fiend - 90 health, attacks every 8 seconds for 18 damage
- Level 3: Decimal Demon - 100 health, attacks every 7 seconds for 20 damage
- Visual telegraph 3 seconds before attacking (increased from 2 seconds)
- Clear reaction animations when taking damage

**Battle Flow:**

1. Player selects spell type (Fire/Ice)
2. Player builds and solves equation using available tiles
3. Successful equation casts spell with visual feedback
4. Enemy attacks on timer
5. Repeat until victory or defeat

**Error Handling:**

- Incorrect equations gently shake with brief red glow
- Misplaced tiles can be removed by tapping them
- If stuck for >15 seconds, subtle hint appears
- Order of operations errors are highlighted with a special indicator
- Focus on understanding the math, not just getting correct answers
- System tracks common errors to help improve the game in future versions

**Victory Condition:** Reduce enemy health to zero before player health reaches zero.

## 3. Progression

**Level Structure:**

- 3 levels with increasing difficulty focused on Grade 5 content
- Level 1: Order of operations with whole numbers and parentheses
- Level 2: Fractions with unlike denominators (addition and subtraction)
- Level 3: Decimals to hundredths (all operations)

**Session Boundaries:**

- Complete gameplay session consists of all 3 levels
- Each level contains a single battle against 1 themed enemy
- Expected session length: 5-8 minutes total
- Progress saves after each completed level
- Clear ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù and ‚ÄúExit‚Äù options after each level

**Session Pacing:**

- Each level designed to take 90-150 seconds (increased maximum from 120)
- Complete v0 experience: ~6-10 minutes (increased from 8)
- Final battle slightly more challenging but still completable by most students

**Success Metrics:**

- Track completion of each level
- Monitor equation solve rate and patterns used
- Capture data on:
  - Time spent per equation
  - Pattern bonus frequency
  - Mathematical concepts used (order of operations, fractions, decimals)
  - Spell type preference
  - Completion rate per level

## 4. Implementation Focus

**Priority Elements:**

- Functional equation building and validation for Grade 5 content
- Order of operations logic with parentheses support
- Fraction and decimal validation and display
- Basic combat loop with health tracking
- Simple visual feedback for successful spells
- Pattern recognition for target numbers and properties
- Level progression with themed content focus
- Basic tutorial system

**Visual Requirements:**

- Simple character/enemy representations themed to match mathematical concepts
- Clear health bars and damage numbers
- Basic spell effects (size varies with power)
- Text indicators for pattern recognition
- Distinct visualizations for different equation types (whole numbers, fractions, decimals)
- Victory and defeat screens with simple stats

**Testing & Feedback:**

- Session-end feedback prompt (3 emojis: üòÄ üòê ‚òπÔ∏è)
- Optional questions: ‚ÄúWhat was your favorite part?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat was most challenging?‚Äù
- Analytics tracking for key metrics
- Auto-capture of session length and completion status

## 5. v0 Success Criteria
