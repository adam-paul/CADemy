## Testing Focus Areas

1. **Conceptual Understanding:** Do players understand order of operations, fraction operations, and decimal operations?
2. **Pattern Discovery:** Do players naturally discover the mathematical properties without explicit guidance?
3. **Difficulty Progression:** Is the jump between levels appropriate for 5th grade students?
4. **Time Pressure Balance:** Are the time allowances appropriate for 5th grade operations?
5. **Engagement Curve:** When does engagement peak/wane during the session?
